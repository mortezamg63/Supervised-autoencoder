# Supervised-autoencoder

This code is an implementation of the paper in the following. 

Le, L., Patterson, A., & White, M. (2018). Supervised autoencoders: Improving generalization performance with unsupervised regularizers. Advances in neural information processing systems, 31, 107-117.

The implementation is done for CIFAR10 and SUSY datasets and results are shown in the following.

Here we have results for CIFAR10.


Here, the results for SUSY
